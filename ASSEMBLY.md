# Assembly

Here comes the fun part!

## Parts list

This is for one side. If you're making 2 sides, well, just double that up.

* 1x ProMicro board (and 2 2.52mm pin headers)
* 2x 2.2kohm resistors
* 1x PJ-320A or MJ-4PP-9 3.5mm jack connector
* 44x Kaihl MX sockets
* 44x 1N4148 diodes (**through hole**)
* 44x MX Cherry (or MX compatible) keyboard switches
* 2x 2U stabilizers

### About diodes

Given the important number of diodes types/models out there, I made some research on what's a good diode/bad diode for a keyboard. Turns out it's not that easy to understand without a good knowledge in electronics. But at the same time, keyboards don't require a really specific diode, just one that has a switching time that's short enough. So in the end, the easiest solution is to use a 1N4148, which fits the criteria and is very common and cheap.

## Process

First, make sure you understand on which side you're supposed to solder/place the component on. This is easy for the left/right PCBs, less easy for the reversible PCB.

The top of the PCB is where the switches will be on. On that side, we'll also have the ProMicro, 3.5mm jack connector and the 2 stabilizers.

On the bottom of the PCB, we'll have the 44 Kailh sockets, the 44 diodes and the 2 resistors.
