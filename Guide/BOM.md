# BOM (list of components)

This is for **one side**. If you're making 2 sides, double that up.

* 1x ProMicro board (and 2 2.52mm pin headers)
* 2x 2.2kohm resistors
* 1x PJ-320A or MJ-4PP-9 3.5mm jack connector
* 44x Kailh MX sockets
* 44x 1N4148 diodes (**through hole**)
* 44x MX Cherry (or MX compatible) keyboard switches
* 2x 2U stabilizers (optional)

### About diodes

Given the important number of diodes types/models out there, I made some research on what's a good diode/bad diode for a keyboard, because I had no idea (yay, learning!). Turns out it's not that easy to understand without a good knowledge in electronics. But at the same time, keyboards don't require a really specific diode, just one that has a switching time that's short enough(?). So in the end, the easiest solution is to use a 1N4148, which is one of the most common diodes, is cheap, and apparently is a good fit for a keyboard.
